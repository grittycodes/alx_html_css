				<h1>Introduction</h1>

				<p>Welcome to my first webpage! I'm so excited to share my thoughts and ideas with the world.</p>
				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I've always been fascinated by technology and the endless possibilities it offers. From building websites to creating apps, there's 
				always something new to learn and explore.</p>
           			<p>One of my favorite things about technology is how it connects people frmo all over the world. Whether it's through social media, 
				online gming, or video conferencing, technology has made it easier than ever to stay in touch with friends and family no matter where 
				they are.</p>
				<p>But technology isn't just about entertainment and communication. It also has the power to change the world for the better. From 
				improving healthcare to fighting climate change, there are countless waysthat technology can make a positive impact on our lives and 
				the world around us.</p>
		
				<h3>My Work</h3>
