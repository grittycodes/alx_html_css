# An Amazing Readme
## My Webpage
This repository contins the HTML files fo my webpage, which is implemented from scratch based on a designer file.

## Project Requirements

- The webpage is implemented using only HTML, with no CSS or styling.
- The designer file is available on Figma. You can create an account to access the final result and duplicate it to your drafts to have access to all design details.
- The focus is on the HTML structure and semantics, using appropriate HTML elements to define the different sections and elements of the page.

## Figma Notes

- If your computer doesn't have the require fonts, you can find them here: [source-sans-pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) and [Spin-Cycle-OT](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/spin-cycle-ot).
- Some values in the designer file may be in float and can be rounded off as needed.

## Usage
- To view the webpage, open the 'index.html' file in a web browser.
